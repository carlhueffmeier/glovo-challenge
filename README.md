# Glovo Full Stack Challenge

A simple full stack application aggregating data from different exchanges using the [moneeda API](https://moneeda.github.io/docs/). I found the challenge by accident while browsing Github (my favorite hobby), and shamelessly used it as an excuse to play with Vue.js ğŸ¤˜

## Tech Stack

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

# Get Started

1. Clone the repository

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/carlhueffmeier/glovo-challenge.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh

3. Configure your environment

```sh
> cp client/.env.example client/.env
# Edit client/.env

> cp server/.env.example server/.env

```

4. Run the project

# Runs both client and server
> npm start
```
